After nearly 20 years of development, Haiku is close to its first stable release, namely R1. We need your help to make it happen. Here's a status update for R1, and latest project news.

## Release Plans

We are planning to release Beta3 sometime next year, hopefully followed by the stable release, R1. We currently have [31](https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&status=in-progress&status=reopened&status=new&group=status&milestone=R1%2Fbeta3) tickets left for Beta 3, and [688](https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&status=in-progress&status=reopened&status=new&group=status&milestone=R1) tickets waiting to be resolved. A big portion of these tickets are bug fixes that are aimed towards the general stability of the system.

Haiku project is by no means a small project, it is a full operating system nonetheless. Maintaining a full-stack operating system is a huge work, and needs more than a handful of developers. Recently, some of our core developers have announced that they will either limit their Haiku-time significantly due to other personal obligations or will take a break from the project. This jeopardizes the possibility of putting a stable release out in a viable timeframe.

**With such breaks and the prolonged absence of the other core developers, currently we do not have the enough developer power to release R1. More beta releases are always possible, but without a stable release, Haiku will never have the chance to become a viable alternative for desktop users.**

Making Haiku something more than an enthusiast operating system is not possible without your help.

## Call for Developers

If you are a C++ developer, we want you to help us in developing and maintaining Haiku. Our priority is to release R1, therefore we need urgent support in fixing R1 milestone bugs. Other than that, improvements on [these areas](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/developing) are necessary to provide a stable and usable user experience for Haiku users.

## Why should I contribute to Haiku?

- Haiku is open source, and licensed with a permissive license (MIT).
- Haiku is inspired by BeOS, which is highly praised as an operating system; now, and back in the day.
- Haiku offers a POSIX compatible operating system designed from scratch, with a focus on clean, readable, and reusable codebase.
- The Haiku experience does not suffer from fragmentation. All Haiku components are maintained in a single codebase, without having to rely on other teams for core system components. No flame wars between Z12 and Roadcountry supporters, or Leprechauns and Krusaders. We don't curse on the mailing lists as well.
- Haiku is a GUI-first operating system, unlike most other FOSS systems. The Terminal is still a first-class citizen after booting the system, right there waiting for you.
- Haiku is the only operating system that completely stays true to the [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor). Tracker is the only remaining mainstream spatial desktop manager. If you are looking for an desktop experience close to the Classic Mac OS, Haiku is your guy.
- Haiku offers a unique solution for package management, which most Linux distributions seem to suffer from. All Haiku packages are mountable disk images, therefore they do not litter your system with copied files everywhere. Updating and recovering the system is as easy as replacing a single file.
- You might find it surprising that we respect the "everything is a file" concept more than other \*nixes.

If you are looking for more detailed content, Andrew Greimann has written an excellent [article](https://osvoyager.wordpress.com/2018/11/30/what-makes-beos-and-haiku-unique/) (2018) on the unique points of BeOS and Haiku. [Haiku User Guide](https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/contents.html) is an excellent source on the Haiku system itself and its components. probono has written an excellent series of Haiku articles (2019), which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@probonopd/my-first-day-with-haiku-shockingly-good-8930cad4bbb0) as well.

## Other Means of Support

If you are not a developer, but still want to support Haiku, we appreciate any support offer. Haiku [needs](https://www.haiku-os.org/community/getting-involved/) QA people, designers, documenters... you name it. Our website currently doesn't have a maintainer for instance.

If you are able to support the project financially, please make a donation. We are looking for means to hire a full-time developer for an extended period of time, but we do not have the financial resources yet to accomplish this goal. Any [donation](https://www.haiku-inc.org/donate/) you make to Haiku, Inc. will help us realize this goal.

You can also make recurring donations on PayPal and [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/haiku.inc/).

## Contact

If you would like to join us, introduce yourself on the [haiku-development](https://www.freelists.org/list/haiku-development) mailing list, [forums](https://discuss.haiku-os.org) or visit us on IRC [#haiku](irc://chat.freenode.net/haiku) channel. In the meantime, download a [nightly](https://download.haiku-os.org), and spin up a VM, or install it on that spare laptop that has been collecting dust for years. See it for yourself.

Let's make the first Haiku stable release a reality.
